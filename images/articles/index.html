            <h2>Killer Instinct Ripper 425 Review</h2>
            <h1>Best Crossbow for Deer Hunting in 2024</h1>
            <p>Today we review the Killer Instinct Ripper 425, the successor to Killer's popular Ripper 415 model. The Ripper 415 has been my favorite Killer crossbow to date, so I was very excited when I got my hands on the Ripper 425. I bought the crossbow two weeks ago and I had time to take it out to the field and test it out. Almost all hunters love this <a href="https://web1.ursuline.org/best-crossbow/">best crossbow for the money</a> on the market.</p>

            <p>The package included the Killer Instinct Ripper 425 crossbow, a LUMIX 4 x 32 IR-W scope, rope cocker, string suppressors, 5-bolt-quiver, three Hypr Bolts (390 grain) with field tips and a stick of rail lube. You should admit it is the best crossbow for deer hunting currently.</p>

            <p>With the crossbow, you get a Killer warranty on standard, non-wearing parts for the life of the crossbow to the original registered owner. Important to know is that the warranty becomes active once the crossbow is registered within 30 days of purchase. This is the reason I like to use the best crossbow for deer hunting.</p>

<h3>Killer Instinct Ripper 425 Crossbow Specs</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Speed: 425 FPS</li>
<li>Weight: 7.5 lbs</li>
<li>Length: 32"-34.5"</li>
<li>Width Axle-to-Axle (uncocked/cocked): 17.75"/14.375"</li>
<li>Draw Weight: 200 lbs</li>
<li>Power Stroke: 15"</li>
<li>Price not available</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Size and Weight</h3>

<p>Killer Instict has designed the Ripper 425 to be high performance, but also to be a comfortable crossbow to handle. The crossbow has a narrow, lean, and lightweight frame. The Ripper 425 measures an overall length of 32 to 34.5 inches and it has an axle-to-axle width of 17.75 inches uncocked and 14.375 inches when cocked. The crossbow weighs 7.5 pounds, is well balanced and manueverable in hunting blinds. Also, I think it is the best crossbow for target shooting.</p>

<h3>Design and Durability</h3>

<p>Killer Instinct completely redesigned the front end and cam system of the Ripper, making the Ripper 425 more durable then its predecessor. Everything of the Ripper 425 feels well designed and I could not find a weakness. Worth mentioning is that if there is any damage on a Killer crossbow like a broken limb then Killer Instinct has a great customer service and they are really fast with sending replacement parts. You can use this crossbow for elk hunting, turkey hunting, hog hunting, moose hunting, bear hunting, whitetail hunting, deer hunting, etc.</p>

<p>From the stock itself they installed a brand new cc style sliding stock. With the old Ripper 415 you needed tools to extend the stock but the Ripper 425 has a button that you push to extend or shorten the stock. You can adjust it in 5-positions for a custom draw length. The forearm grip also provides custom comfort. You can see this is the best crossbow for women, youth, and elderly hunters.</p>

<p>The Ripper 425 is built with a CNC machined riser and a CNC machined aluminum flight rail for enhanced downrange accuracy. Also worth mentioning is that the Chaos AE looks great and the finish is done well. It makes the crossbow look more expensive. It is the best crossbow for home defense and self defense.</p>

<h3>Dead Silent Kit</h3>

<p>The Ripper 425 is outfitted with Killer's so called Dead Silent Kit consisting of rubber string dampeners and limb suppressors to reduce noise and vibration.</p>

<h3>Optics</h3>

<p>The Killer Instinct Ripper 425 comes with a LUMIX 1.5x5-32 speed ring scope, which is better than the standard 4x32 scope. The scope has five brightness settings in red or blue for low light conditions. It not a great crossbow scope in 2024 but it is a fine scope that performs well.</p>

<h3>Killer Instinct Ripper 425 Scope Close up</h3>

<p>To calibrate the scope, you start at ten yards away. Shoot at a target with your crossbow and adjust the scope until the bolt or arrow hits the target. Once you have succeeded you go back to the desired distance for your upper reticle and shoot again. Now adjust the scope to hit what you are aiming at. People also like to use this crossbow for survival.</p>

<p>Example: If you are shooting at twenty yards and your crossbow is shooting three inches high and one and a half inches to the left, adjust the wind correction by turning counterclockwise about 15 clicks.</p>

<p>To zero the scope you adjust the elevation tower by turning about 32 clicks clockwise.</p>

<h3>Trigger Mechanism</h3>

<p>The Killer Instinct Ripper 425 features a 3.5-pound KillerTech Trigger that provides a smooth and crisp pull. The KillerTech Trigger system provides good shot control and is very consistent. The trigger has no discernible creep whatsoever.</p>

<h3>Safety Features</h3>

<p>The Ripper 425 comes with all the safety features you'd want from a 2021 crossbow. The crossbow is safe to use by both right- and left-handed users.</p>

<p>The trigger assembly contains an ambidextrous safety switch and anti-dry fire that protects the user from moving the safety from "safe" to the "fire" position without an arrow in place.</p>

<h3>Cocking</h3>

<p>The Ripper 425 is easy to cock. It has a 200 pound draw weight that you can cut in half with the in the package included rope cocker. The crossbow is build with a nice big stirrup.</p>

<p>The Ripper 425 can also be cocked with a crank. The Killer Instinct Dead Silent Crank is crank is sold separately.</p>

<h3>Arrows and Quiver</h3>

<p>The HYPR carbon 20 inch crossbow bolts are heavyweight bolts that help the to deliver maximum penetration. They were designed for greater penetration and greater accuracy. They weigh 390 grain and have a straightness to +/- 0.003-inch for maximum consistency.</p>

<p>The side mount quiver is of high quality material and can hold a total of 5 bolts or arrows.

<h3>Speed and Accuracy</h3>

<p>The Ripper 425 has a 200 pound draw weight and a mighty 15 inch power stroke. This incredibly fast crossbow punches 390 grain Hypr bolts through targets with speeds up to 425 feet per second with an impressive 156 foot-pounds of kinetic energy for deep penetration. That's why we like this Killer Instinct crossbow deeply.</p>

<p>The Ripper 425 is also incredibly accurate. I had within 2 inch groupings at a distance of 50 yards on my first day and 1 inch groupings at 70 yards with a 4mph wind that same week. Just like the Ripper 415 this is a highly accurate crossbow which is impressive considering the price of the crossbow.</p>

<h3>Assembly and Sighting-in</h3>

<p>The Ripper 425 is an easy crossbow to assemble and the scope is also easy to sight in. Read the owner's manual in the package and you'll be fine, even if you've never set up a crossbow. You can also go to a Killer Instinct crossbow dealer location. They'll be happy to help you setting up the hunting crossbow.</p>

<h2>Recommended Accessories</h2>

<h3>Arrows and Broadheads</h3>

            <p>We recommend the Killer Instinct HYPR Lite 20 inch carbon crossbow bolts. They weigh 390 grain. Combine them with Rage Crossbow X broadheads. These crossbow broadheads are optimised for high velocity crossbows. They are available in either 100 grain or 125 grain and feature a 2 inch cutting diameter. Killer Instinct is the best crossbow for beginners.</p>

<h3>Cocking Crank</h3>

            <p>The Killer Instinct Magtek DCS dead silent crossbow crank is now unavailable on Amazon. I'll update this review when the crank becomes available.In the meantime, you can see if Killer Instinct can provide you with one via killercrossbow.com.</p>

<h3>Storage and Transportation</h3>

            <p>We recommend the Killer Instinct Slayer Crossbow case, it fits the Ripper 425 perfectly. Its a fine case that also looks great and keeps your crossbow safe from water, bumps, and drops during storage and transportation. The case also has three internals and a single external storage compartment for bolts, sights, etc.</p>

            <p>There is no crossbow sling in the package. If you want a crossbow sling to comfortably carry the Ripper 425 then we recommend a Southland Archery universal crossbow sling. This lightweight nylon crossbow sling is suitable for most crossbows.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

              <p>The Ripper 425 is a great successor to the Ripper 415. The crossbow is well balanced, durable, very accurate and faster than its predecessor. Killer has delivered another great affordable crossbow that will make many hunters on a smaller budget very happy this year. For under 500 bucks this is a fantastic high performance crossbow that can compete with the best! Now, the Killer Instinct crossbows are very popular in the world.</p>
